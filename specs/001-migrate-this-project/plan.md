# Implementation Plan: Next.js SEO Optimization & Migration

**Branch**: `001-migrate-this-project` | **Date**: 18 September 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-migrate-this-project/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, or `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Optimize existing Next.js 15 application for enhanced SEO performance through improved metadata management, structured data implementation, sitemap generation, and performance optimization. Focus on search engine visibility and social media sharing capabilities while maintaining current functionality.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3, React 18.2, Next.js 15.0.3  
**Primary Dependencies**: @headlessui/react, AOS animation library, TailwindCSS 3.3.6, Sharp image optimization  
**Storage**: Static file system, no database required for SEO optimization  
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library (to be configured), Lighthouse for SEO auditing  
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser + search engines), deployed as standalone  
**Project Type**: web - Next.js frontend application with App Router  
**Performance Goals**: <3 second page load, Lighthouse SEO score >90, Core Web Vitals compliance  
**Constraints**: Maintain existing UI/UX, preserve current functionality, support English and Bahasa Malaysia  
**Scale/Scope**: Landing page optimization, ~10-15 routes, mosque management system marketing site

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Note**: Constitution file contains template placeholders. Applying standard web development principles:
- ✅ **No Constitutional Violations**: SEO optimization follows standard Next.js practices
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Using built-in Next.js metadata API and standard SEO libraries  
- ✅ **Test-First**: SEO improvements are measurable via Lighthouse audits
- ✅ **Performance**: Focus on Core Web Vitals and page speed optimization

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Current Next.js app structure is appropriate for frontend SEO optimization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each SEO contract → implementation task [P]
- Each data model entity → TypeScript interface task [P] 
- Each user story → SEO validation task
- Metadata generation tasks for each page type
- Structured data implementation tasks
- Sitemap generation and optimization tasks
- Image optimization improvement tasks
- Performance monitoring setup tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup first: TypeScript interfaces, utility functions
- Core features: Metadata generation, structured data
- Optimization: Image optimization, performance monitoring
- Validation: SEO auditing, testing setup
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- 5 setup/configuration tasks
- 8 core SEO implementation tasks  
- 4 optimization tasks
- 5 validation/testing tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
